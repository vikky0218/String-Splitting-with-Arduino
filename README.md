# Arduino String Split Example

This Arduino project serves as a demonstration of how to split a string in Arduino using a custom function. The example code is designed to handle serial communication and process incoming data.

## Overview

The main features of this project include:

- String splitting functionality for Arduino.
- Serial communication data processing.
- Example scenarios for parsing and extracting information from received data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE installed.
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino UNO) for testing.
